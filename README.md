BluetoothDetectorgoProRecorderYUN
=================================

This is a program to allow an Arduino Yun and a bluetooth mate Silver to pick up bluetooth devices and consequently command a goPro through wifi to record a short video.

For information on setting this up and information on issues I had with connecting all the three main components, please visit my blog here: http://martyf1y.tumblr.com/post/99800203605/device-detecting-device

Let me know if there are any issues or possible improvements.
